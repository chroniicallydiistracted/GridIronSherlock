# GridIron Sherlock

**GridIron Sherlock** is a cross-provider, analytics-driven fantasy football companion that links to a userâ€™s league, computes advanced metrics and projections, and optimizes roster decisions with explainable recommendations. Our vision is to help you detect hidden edges faster than your opponents and provide precise, explainable advice.
