# Contributing

- Follow the SPEC and CONTRACTS first (see CONTRACTS/).
- Work on feature branches named: feat/xxx or fix/xxx.
- Open small PRs per AGENTS.md milestone cadence.
- Every PR must include tests, docs updates, and the PR template checklist.
- Keep secrets out of the repo â€” use .env locally and secret stores in CI.
- Run `make setup` then `make test` before opening a PR.
